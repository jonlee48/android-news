- No special instructions or limitations that I know of.
- Example search:
  - A search term that will yield results if skipping source selection
    - "rain"
  - A search term, plus a source that will yield results
    - "covid", Health category, Medical News Today
  - A rough area of the world map I can long-tap on to view “local” news.
    - Any US state will give you search results for that state (E.g. Virginia)
    - Any foreign country will give you results for that country
